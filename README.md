Afterwards it asks you about quantity of variables you would like to count and depending on your ansver (from 1 to 6) 
chooses the formula and prints the result.

Then it asks you to input your own result and, if it wasn`t right, givs one more chance to answer this time correctly.

For the correct answer from the second time ('Lasr chance') it won`t be written any 'perfect'. Just '=' + result.
